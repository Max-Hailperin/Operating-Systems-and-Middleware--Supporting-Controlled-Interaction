<h2>Revised Edition</h2>
<p>The information here is for version 1.1.5, released on 2013-12-16 as an update to the original 1.1 from 2011-07-27.
<ul>
<li><p><a href="osm-rev1.1.4.pdf">PDF file version of the book.</a>
<!-- I commented out the link to a directory of separate PDF files for individual chapters because I haven't found
any way to preserve the hyperref cross-reference links when splitting the PDF file up.
Also, with those cross-reference links and bookmarks, one can easily get to individual
chapters within the single PDF file, reducing the importance of the split version. -->
<!-- <li><p><a href="osm-rev1.1-chapters/">Separate PDF files for individual chapters.</a> -->
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Max-Hailperin/Operating-Systems-and-Middleware--Supporting-Controlled-Interaction">LaTeX source files of the book are available from a github repository</a> suitable for those wishing to modify the book or convert it to another format.
<!-- I commented out the link to a zip of the source, because now that I'm including the web site in the git repository,
it seems too confusing to also have a zip of the repository in the web site. Maybe some day. -->
<!-- (In case of trouble with the repository, there is also a local <a href="osm-rev1.1.1.zip">zip file of the source</a>.) -->
<li><p><a href="osm-rev1.1-pdf-figures.zip">PDF files of the figures.</a>
This is a 1.3 MB zip file containing one PDF file for each artwork
figure in the text.  (Figures consisting entirely of code, tables, or other
textual elements are not included.)  The individual PDF files within
the zip file have names based on the figure numbers.  For example,
<code>hail_f0612.pdf</code> contains Figure 6.12.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="osm-rev1.1-programs.zip">Code of the programs.</a>
This is a zip file containing one directory per chapter, with names
such as <code>ch02</code> for Chapter 2.  (However, there are no
directories for Chapters 1, 5, and 11, as those chapters do not
include any programs.)  Within each directory are individual files of
Java, C, and C++ source code, with names corresponding to those used
in the text.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Max-Hailperin/Operating-Systems-and-Middleware--Supporting-Controlled-Interaction/issues">A continually
updated list of errors, maintained in github's issue tracker.</a>  Please report any additional
